# Lab 1 

- Install gradle7.x (not 8.x!), then `gradle build`
- Run a webserver, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Open `localhost:8000` in your browser, and navigate to `build/web`

## gradlew
Instead of installing gradle, you can also simply run the `gradlew[.bat]` script, which will pull the correct version of gradle to the `gradle` folder. *(For more details, see the [documentation of gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).)*
